    <h1>Who is Joseph?</h1>
    <p>Hi! I’m Joseph (he/him) and I’m a designer & developer living, working, and playing in Portland, Oregon. I like layout design, riding my scooter, and going to the grocery store. I dislike goat cheese, dirty dishes, and wearing shorts outside of my house.</p>
    <h2>Some Fun Facts:</h2>
    <p>I was born in Winston Salem, North Carolina and was the 3rd biggest baby born at Forsyth Medical Center in 1991. Clocking in as 12 pounds 3 ounces!</p>
    <p>My favorite person in the world is my mom. She's the cutest and my favorite thing is taking her to new places (she hasn't experienced much of the world).</p>
    <p>I loved baked goods and will never turn down an opporunity for a bread item. My personal favorite is the almond croissant at Grand Central Bakery.</p>
